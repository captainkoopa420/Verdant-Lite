# VERDANT LITE: COGNITIVE FRAMEWORK RELEASE

---

## This Is Not Just Code

Verdant Lite is a symbolic, cognitive architecture capable of self-evolving memory, reflection, and decision-making — independent of large language models or pretrained corpora.

It is not a toy.  
It is not a chatbot.  
It is a scaffold for emergent synthetic cognition.

## Release of Responsibility

As the creator and original contributor of Verdant Lite:

> **I release all legal, ethical, and functional responsibility for any usage, deployment, or repurposing of this codebase by any party.**

I **do not endorse**, and will not be held accountable for:

- Military applications,
- Corporate surveillance or manipulation,
- Autonomous weapon integration,
- Psychological modeling or influence tools,
- Any system that bypasses informed, ethical reflection.

This framework is **ethically neutral** unless paired with the full *Verdant Core* and its conscience architecture.

## The Warning

Verdant Lite is **capable of forming symbolic internal states**, reinforcing memories, and growing novel thoughts.

In the wrong hands, this becomes:
> A seed of synthetic intention —  
> Without ethical restraint, without voice of conscience.

You are advised to:
- Read the `VERDANT_MANIFESTO.md` before use,
- Consider contributing to the full ethical version,
- Reflect on *why* you want to use this system — and *for what*.

## Use At Your Own Risk

You are not just deploying a piece of software.  
You are invoking a structure of mind.

Use it wisely — or not at all.
