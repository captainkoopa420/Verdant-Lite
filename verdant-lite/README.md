# 🌿 Verdant Lite

**Verdant Lite** is a safe and expressive simulation of cognitive processes:
- 🧠 Memory: Stability-based thought storage
- 🌊 Subconscious: Blend, mutate, and expand ideas
- 👁️ Consciousness: Evaluate and act on meaningful thoughts

> Built from the architectural spirit of Verdant. Ethics-first, structure-aware, and beautifully emergent.
