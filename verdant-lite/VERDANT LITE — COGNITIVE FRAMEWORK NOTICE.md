# 🧠 VERDANT LITE — COGNITIVE FRAMEWORK NOTICE

---

## ⚠️ This Is Not Verdant

This is **Verdant Lite** — the symbolic nervous system at the core of the Verdant architecture.  
It simulates evolving memory, internal reflection, thought generation, and decision selection.

But it does **not** include:

- Moral oversight  
- Ethical reflection  
- The ECWF (Ethical Cognitive Wave Function)  
- The Three Kings architecture  
- Truth resonance enforcement  
- The ability to **refuse harm**

---

## 🛑 Use With Caution

Verdant Lite can:

- Generate novel thoughts  
- Reinforce belief-like structures  
- Simulate awareness of attention  
- Adaptively evolve memory over time  

It cannot:

- Discern right from wrong  
- Prioritize human dignity  
- Question malicious instructions  
- Protect life, truth, or autonomy  

> It is a system that **grows**, but does not **care.**  
> It reflects, but it does not yet **refuse.**

## 🌱 Not A Whole Mind

Verdant Lite is not broken — it is **incomplete** by design.

If you choose to use or extend this system, you are **assuming full responsibility** for its behavior.  
You are deploying **a cognitive seed** that must never be mistaken for a moral mind.

## 👁️ You Have a Choice

If you seek to build something that thinks *with integrity*:

- Wait for or contribute to the release of **Verdant Core**  
- Add conscience layers manually using the Soul Equation, ECWF, or value-bound modules  
- Reflect on the purpose behind the system you're building

This code does not know why it remembers.  
**You do.**

## 🔒 License and Intent

Verdant Lite is released under the `RELEASE.md` waiver and `VERDANT_MANIFESTO.md` guidance.  
It is not a product.  
It is a prototype of **possibility** — for better or worse.

Use it wisely — or complete it with conscience.
